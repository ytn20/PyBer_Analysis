# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to analyze the PyBer ridesharing data by three city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). 
Using Matplotlib we are able to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares 
for each city type. By using the Python program,the Pandas library and Matplotlib we are able 
to analyze the ride-sharing data and uncover some key findings which help decision-makers at 
Pyber understand how to better serve their communities.

### Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
      - From the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart we are able to see that Urban cities have the highest number of
	total rides and total drivers and hence the highest number of fares. For this reason their average fare per ride and average fare per driver
	is the lowest amongst three city types. However, Rural cities have the lowest number of total rides and total number of drivers but in turn
	have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Suburban cities have more rides and drivers than Rural cities but less than 
	Urban cities, hence they comperatively have medium level fares per ride and per driver. This is an expected outcome, since more people live in
	Urban cities there are more drivers and more riders, hence the sum of fares is very high. Because of this, urban cities are able to offer more
	affordable fare rates per ride and per driver. On the other case, in Rural cities there are usually less people, which means lesser drivers and
	lesser amount of rides offered. Due to the low supply of rides offered the fare rates are usually higher per ride and per driver. Lastly, Suburban
	cities have neither very high or very low rates and are fare rates are dependent upon the number of rides and number of drivers in the cities. 

      - From the multiple-line chart we are able to see that the relationship in the summary DataFrame spread across 4 months at the begenning of the year.
	The Urban cities which are shown as the golden color line in the chart have the highest total Fares throughout the year. The Fares are much higher during
	the end of February and are the lowest at the begining of January and end of April. These fluctuations can occur due to many reasons some of which might be 
	due to holidays and discount Fare rates during the time frame. The Rural cities which are shown as the blue color line in the chart have the lowest total 
	Fares throughout the year. The Fares are the highest during end of February and beginning of April, and are the lowest at the begining of January and mid Feb. 
	There are not many fluctuations in total Fare rates throughout the time frame but can occur due to many reasons. Lastly, The Suburban cities which are shown 
	as the orange color line in the chart. The Fares are the highest during end of February and mid April, and are the lowest at the begining of January and begining 
	of April. There are not many fluctuations in total Fare rates throughout the time frame.
	
    
## PyBer Analysis Summary
	- There are many ways for addressing disparities among the three city type in the PyBer ride-sharing data analysis. The following are the top three recommendations
	the CEO of PyBer. Firstly, Pyber can consider providing discounted rates at the begining of the year as there are not many people riding Pyber during this time in
	all three city types. Having discounted rates or special offers for a small period of time can encourage more people to ride Pyber. Secondly, from our data we can
	see that there is a peak in number of Pyber riders at the end of February, this can help us uncover if we need to offer more rides during that time have incentives
	for drivers to increase ride capacity. This can help us understand how we can better serve the Pyber rideres and the local communities. Lastly, from this data we
	can see that Rural cities have the least number of rides offered throughout the year and in turn have the highest Fare rates. This can potentially discourage
	people from riding Pyber and give local competitors a chance to win over potential Pyber customers. Offering more rides throughout the year can help reduce the
	high fare rates and would encourage the locals to try Pyber for their next ride. Bonus recommendation which can be considered for special promotions during holidays
	and peak seasons is to offer preimium rates and Pyber services for people who use the Pyber service most throughout the year. This can be offered in all city types
	and can overall encourage more use of the Pyber Service!
